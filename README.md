- Minimize a window if it already has focus
- Show date and time
- Use a JSON config file to control date/time format and other settings (Not yet implemented)
- Desktop button - Minimize all windows with a single click
- Show tooltips on hover
- Provide a context menu for window actions
- Support additional toolbars (planned)

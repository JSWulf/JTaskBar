# JTaskBar â€” A Vertical Taskbar for Windows 11

A lightweight, configurable vertical taskbar for Windows 11, designed for power users in restricted environments.

---

## Why This Exists

Windows 11 removed support for vertical taskbars. This project restores that functionality with the following constraints:

- Must not require administrative rights
- Cannot rely on Microsoft Store distribution
- Must be usable in secured enterprise environments

---

## Core Goals

- Bring a window to focus on click
- Minimize a window if it already has focus
- Show date and time
- Use a JSON config file to control date/time format and other settings
- Minimize all windows with a single click, and restore them if clicked again
- Show tooltips on hover
- Provide a context menu for window actions
- Support additional toolbars (planned)

---

## Current Features (as of July 2025)

- Enumerates and displays open windows
- Click-to-focus and minimize-on-reselect
- AppBar-style docking (left or right)
- Adjustable width
- Tooltip with delayed display and improved positioning
- Foreground window is auto-highlighted
- Ghost/utility windows are filtered out
- Icons displayed for most windows (with fallback for legacy apps)
- Desktop button to minimize/restore all windows
- Context menu with:
  - Restore
  - Minimize
  - Close
  - Open file location
  - Open Task Manager
- Custom spacing between list items
- Responsive to screen resolution and monitor layout changes
